This repository contains all scripts developed during the internship. It includes:

Reading the database and converting files to .nii format.

Converting to 3D masks and processing them to clean and separate left/right structures.

Scripts for generating DRR (Digitally Reconstructed Radiographs).

Implementation of PCA in MATLAB for shape analysis.

Each folder contains the necessary .yml files to run the programs. The logbook/documentation can also be consulted to check software versions and tool configurations.

For the PCA on MATLAB, the script that has implemented all the functions is PCA_TIBIA
